🖥️ Why I Built This

After many vanilla playthroughs, I started experimenting with cheats/mods. Constantly alt-tabbing to search and type codes ruined the flow. This project keeps everything in one place, making cheats quick and seamless to use.

🚀 Getting Started

Clone or download this repo.

Open the project in Visual Studio (or your preferred IDE).

Build and run the application.

Launch KOTOR 1 and select your cheat from the app.

📂 Project Status

✅ ~85% of cheat codes implemented

🔄 Remaining codes will be added over time
