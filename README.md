# Kotor 1 Trainer CSharp
basic windows form application using memory.dll in C# for one of my favourite games knights of the old republic

to enable cheats you need to go to your game directory and find the file called swkotorini
open it in a text editor like notepad++ or any of your choice 
under the game options you need to write EnableCheats = 1 and save the file 

after that you will now have access to the games command console by pressing ` 
now every option within my trainer will now work 

any bugs please leave a reply on my github repositroy for me to fix or if you have any suggestions 
or would like to contribute to the development of the trainer for kotor please let me know 
if people really like this over having to manually type everything in i may consider 
dooing the same for kotor 2 but havent yet decided 

enjoy & May the force be with you!
